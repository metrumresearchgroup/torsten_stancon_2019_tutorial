	abstract = {Polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate containing monomethyl auristatin E, was associated with an incidence of grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) of 55-72\% in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a phase II study, when dosed 1.8-2.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks until progression or for a maximum of 17 cycles. To quantify the correlation of conjugate exposure and treatment duration with PN risk, a time-to-event model was developed using data from phase I and II studies. The model suggested that PN risk increased with conjugate exposure and treatment cycles, and a trend for increased risk with body weight and albumin concentration. When capping the treatment duration to six to eight cycles, the risk ratio of a dose of 2.4 mg/kg vs. 1.8 mg/kg was ≥1.29; the predicted incidence of grade ≥2 PN at 1.8-2.4 mg/kg dose levels was 17.8-37.2\%, which is comparable with other antimicrotubule agents for lymphoma treatment.},
