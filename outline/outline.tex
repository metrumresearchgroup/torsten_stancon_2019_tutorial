\textbf{
{\Large Population and ODE-based models \\ using Stan and Torsten}}

\ \\
\textit{Instructors:} Charles Margossian and Yi Zhang \\
\textit{Length}: 1 day  \\

\ \\
\textbf{Description:} \\
This class focuses on fitting models in pharmacometrics.
We consider the following challenges when building such models: 
(i) the data generating process involves solutions to ODE systems,
(ii) these ODEs are embedded in a complicated event schedule,
and (iii) the data comes from various sources, for instance various patients and studies,
and the resulting models are hierarchical.
Note that these properties are not specific to pharmacometrics,
and arise in other fields such as epidemiology, geology, and econometrics.
To accommodate a broad audience, we will keep the core concepts general,
and review basic notions of pharmacometrics, so that participants from all fields
can do the exercises.

The course covers elementary techniques to solve ODEs in Stan,
the efficient parametrization of hierarchical models,
and within-chain parallelization.
We also introduce \textit{Torsten}, an extension of Stan for pharmacometrics,
which allows us to seamlessly combine the above methods.

\ \\
\textbf{Prerequesites:} \\
Participants should be familiar with Bayesian statistics and basic Stan.
The requisite material is covered in the introductory tutorial and the tutorial on hierarchical modeling
at Stan Con 2019, which participants can attend before coming to this workshop.
